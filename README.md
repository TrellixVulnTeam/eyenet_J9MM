EyeNet was built with the vision of contributing to the fight against diabetes. This software utilizes retinal images to diagnose likelihood of diabetes using Convolutional Neural Networks and also provides an interactive GUI where desired images can be imported to get prediction outcomes.

The git repository doesn't contain the dataset due to storage constraints. Please read through the EyeNet guide to make sure you can download the dataset and do the set up properly.
